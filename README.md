# Classic Cakes

## Overview

A website for a small local cake shop owner based in Northamptonshire.
The website features a home page with information about the shop and testimonials, a gallery of prior work, a page to enquire about baking lessons including a video example 
and a contact page with location details and a form for general enquiries.
For this website, the primary goal is to persuade potential customers to make contact with the shop via the lessons or contact page.

This website tries to allow the potential customer to find all the information that they need to make a decision to visit the shop by breaking the information into relevant 
pages and making it clear and easy to contact the shop in a number of ways.

## UX

### **Strategy**

The business goals of this website are:
* To build brand awareness of Classic Cakes.
* To provide high quality examples of the shop’s range and style
* To drive sales through; lesson enquiries which will lead to a booking call with the owner, contact page enquiries which would lead to customers visiting the shop to make a purchase or requesting a custom cake for a specific event.
* To provide distinguished UX to encourage potential clients to visit the store and to keep them using the site long enough to complete one of the forms.

The customer goals of this website are:
* To find delicious, beautiful cakes for events, a special treat or just to satisfy a sweet tooth.
* To easily find the types of cake on offer.
* To intuitively navigate to the lessons page and fill out the enquiry form to improve baking skills.
* To intuitively navigate to the contact page to find the store location.

Visitors to this website are searching for:
* A business to design and create a beautiful wedding cake for their special day.
* A birthday cake for a family member.
* Cupcake trays for special events or parties.
* Lessons to help improve their baking skills.

The ideal client for this business is:
* Living in Northamptonshire.
* Someone who regularly throws catered events.
* A cake lover.
* Engaged to be married.

This website is the best way to help them achieve these things because:
* Most local cake shop websites have extremely poor UX.
* Other local cake shop websites contain far too much content and therefore produce information overload quickly.
* This website is:
   * Intuitive and easy to navigate.
   * Able to guide the client through all the relevant information in a way that is easy to understand.
   * Able to guide them to the goal of the website - to fill out either the lessons or contact form.

7. As a returning visitor to the website, I want to easily navigate to the contact page to put details of a new request in.

### **Scope**

Based on the simple customer and business goals of Classic Cakes, the scope of the project and the features available needed to be fairly narrow so as not to overcomplicate and confuse the user.

#### Initial Feature Plan

These items must be completed for initial release:

* Gallery of **images** to convey the quality of work to the user.
* **Compelling copy** introducing the more novel idea of cake making lessons to the user.
* A contact form allowing the user to provide detailed descriptions of their request.

### **Structure**

Consistency, Predictability and Learnability:

This website will follow convention for its navigational elements. Predictably, these will be found at the top of the browser window on any screen size and will be consistent in their coloring and design.
Consistency will also be applied to headings and any other relevant information a user may need to understand quickly when visiting a page for the first time.
This will give the website a high learnability and will be largely intuitive for moving through the content even if they don't wish to follow the linear arrangement of the pages. 

Visibility:

The website will employ content hinting as part of its design on each page so as to encourage users to scroll to gain more detail, and more importantly for the business owner, complete a form.

Feedback:

Feedback will also be added to the website for links where possible as well as the submission button for the planned contact form. The form will also provide feedback should there be an error with any of the form entries.

### **Skeleton**

##### Wireframe mockups: 

Wireframes First Drafts:

* [Home](assets/images/readme-images/wireframe-draft-home.jpg)
* [Gallery](assets/images/readme-images/wireframe-draft-gallery.jpg)
* [Lessons](assets/images/readme-images/wireframe-draft-lessons.jpg)
* [Contact](assets/images/readme-images/wireframe-draft-contact.jpg)

Upon adding content to the website, it quickly became clear that the 1:1 ratio for the top of the majority of pages felt out of balance.
In order to fill the left hand side with enough information to not look empty, the website would have to sacrifice being succint and risk losing the user's interest.
To prevent this, the ratio was adapted to 1:2 which have the images and videos more impact and made the headings more punchy.

The gallery was also redesigned to remove the translucent colour cover, as once this was in place it was clear that it was obscuring the quality of the photos rather than adding a cohesiveness as was intended.

The map on the Contact page was changed to a hero image as the map colour scheme and aesthetic didn't flow with the rest of the website.

Both the hero video on the Lessons page and the map/hero image on the Contact page were changed to not display on mobiles to increase the visibility of the more important content and reduce data usage for mobile users.

#### Implemented Features
 
All the pages feature a typical **header** that users will be familiar with; a responsive **navigation bar** which includes the Classic Cakes **logo** in the top left and links to the website’s other pages in the top right. 
They all also feature a **footer** with **telephone contact information** as well as **social media icons** which link to Classic Cakes’ facebook and instagram pages.
 
Each page also includes **headings** relevant to the page on the left third below the header, and either a **hero image** or **hero video** on the right two thirds below the header. 
The purpose of both the headings and the images/video is to either verbally or visually reinforce the purpose of the page in an eye-catching way that will give a positive emotional response to the user.
 
##### Home:
 
The headings on the Home page contain some **compelling copy** which delivers the main message on the page and encourages the user to explore the page further. 
There is also a **call to action button** here guiding the user to visit the Lessons page.
 
The hero image on the Home page is visible on desktops and tablet devices, as at these larger screen sizes the user can absorb the information they convey. 
On smaller screen sizes, the hero image is not displayed as this gives a cleaner view of the headings and therefore the purpose of the page, and also reduces the mobile users’ data consumption.
 
The next section of the page details the types of product on offer, using interactive **photographs** as well as **testimonials** relating to the product they are paired with. 
On smaller screen sizes, the reviews are not displayed as this would hinder the user’s ability to quickly establish what Classic Cake’s main product offerings are.
 
##### Gallery:
 
The Gallery page contains 24 **thumbnail images** laid out at equal distance, the number on each row is adapted to the width of the screen.
Each thumbnail is circular, is in keeping with the images found on the Home page and features various types of cake on offer.
 
##### Lessons:
 
The headings on the lessons page also contain **compelling copy** and a **call to action** button only this time the button leads the user to the Contact page. 
On desktops and tablets there is then a **hero video** which autoplays on mute as a background element and reinforces the product offering visually. 
On mobiles, the hero video is not displayed as this gives a cleaner view of the headings and therefore the purpose of the page, and also reduces the mobile users’ data consumption.
 
There is then a detailed **description** of the product offering followed by a **pricing table**.
 
Finally, a **contact form** specifically for lesson enquiries which has boxes for name, email and phone number, the size of the group they wish to learn in, whether they want to learn online or in the Classic Cakes kitchen and any other information that may be relevant. 
At the end of the form there is a **Send Button** which triggers a **modal** to appear when clicked.
 
##### Contact:
 
The Contact page has similar features to the Home page; some headings which have **contact information** including street address, phone number and email address, and a hero image on larger screen sizes which does not display on mobile.
 
This is followed by a **contact form** specifically for enquiring about or ordering cakes which has boxes for name, email and phone number, a dropdown for the cake type the user is interested in and any other information that may be relevant. 
At the end of the form there is a **Send Button** which triggers a **modal** to appear when clicked.

### **Surface**

#### Colour Scheme

Initially the website had a purple-based colour scheme as purple can convey extravagence and royalty which fits the high-end branding of Classic Cakes.
However, when it came to collecting appropriate imagery for the website, the vast majority of images available were better suited to a pink-based scheme. 
I felt that it was more important to have a cohesive, consistent website with an appropriate colour scheme and pink most closely matched the original designs.

#### Typography

Both fonts used in the website were from Google Fonts.

Logo and Call to Action buttons - **"Pacifico"**:

![Pacifico](assets/images/readme-images/pacifico.png)

The handwritten feel of this font is very much on brand for a classic, high-end business. 
However, the font was not clear enough to use across all headings as it was only available in a font weight of 400.

All other text - **"Montserrat"**:

![Montserrat](assets/images/readme-images/montserrat.png)

This simple sans-serif font allowed for easy reading, even on the smallest screen sizes.
Letter spacing and font size was utilised to make headings stand out despite being the same font as the rest of the body.
