## Cake Shop

A website for a small local cake shop owner based in Northamptonshire.
The website features a home page with information about the shop and testimonials, a gallery of prior work, a page to enquire about baking lessons including video examples 
and a contact page with location details and a form for general enquiries.
For this website, the primary goal is to persuade potential customers to make contact with the shop via the lessons or contact page.

This website tries to allow the potential customer to find all the information that they need to make a decision to visit the shop by breaking the information into relevant 
pages and making it clear and easy to contact the shop in a number of ways.

The business goals of this website are:
* To build brand awareness.
* To provide high quality examples of the shop’s range and style
* To drive sales through; lesson enquiries which will lead to a booking call with the owner, contact page enquiries which would lead to customers visiting the shop to make a purchase or requesting a custom cake for a specific event.
* To provide distinguished UX to encourage potential clients to visit the store and to keep them using the site long enough to complete one of the forms.

The customer goals of this website are:
* To find delicious, beautiful cakes for events, a special treat or just to satisfy a sweet tooth.
* To easily find the types of cake on offer.
* To intuitively navigate to the lessons page and fill out the enquiry form to improve baking skills.
* To intuitively navigate to the contact page to find the store location.

## UX

#### Ideal client

##### The ideal client for this business is:
* Living in Northamptonshire.
* Someone who regularly throws catered events.

##### Visitors to this website are searching for:
* A business to design and create a beautiful wedding cake for their special day.
* A birthday cake for a family member.

##### This project is the best way to help them achieve these things because:
* Most local cake shop websites have extremely poor UX.

   * Intuitive and easy to navigate.
   * Able to guides the client through all the relevant information in a way that is easy to understand.
   * Able to guide them to the goal of the website - to fill out either the lessons or contact form.
