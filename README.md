# Classic Cakes

## Cake Shop

A website for a small local cake shop owner based in Northamptonshire.
The website features a home page with information about the shop and testimonials, a gallery of prior work, a page to enquire about baking lessons including video examples 
and a contact page with location details and a form for general enquiries.
For this website, the primary goal is to persuade potential customers to make contact with the shop via the lessons or contact page.

This website tries to allow the potential customer to find all the information that they need to make a decision to visit the shop by breaking the information into relevant 
pages and making it clear and easy to contact the shop in a number of ways.

The business goals of this website are:
* To build brand awareness.
* To provide high quality examples of the shop’s range and style
* To drive sales through; lesson enquiries which will lead to a booking call with the owner, contact page enquiries which would lead to customers visiting the shop to make a purchase or requesting a custom cake for a specific event.
* To provide distinguished UX to encourage potential clients to visit the store and to keep them using the site long enough to complete one of the forms.

The customer goals of this website are:
* To find delicious, beautiful cakes for events, a special treat or just to satisfy a sweet tooth.
* To easily find the types of cake on offer.
* To intuitively navigate to the lessons page and fill out the enquiry form to improve baking skills.
* To intuitively navigate to the contact page to find the store location.

## UX

#### Ideal client

##### The ideal client for this business is:
* Living in Northamptonshire.
* Someone who regularly throws catered events.
* A cake lover.
* Engaged to be married.

##### Visitors to this website are searching for:
* A business to design and create a beautiful wedding cake for their special day.
* A birthday cake for a family member.
* Cupcake trays for special events or parties.
* Lessons to help improve their baking skills.

##### This project is the best way to help them achieve these things because:
* Most local cake shop websites have extremely poor UX.
* Other local cake shop websites contain far too much content and therefore produce information overload quickly.
* This website is:
   * Intuitive and easy to navigate.
   * Able to guides the client through all the relevant information in a way that is easy to understand.
   * Able to guide them to the goal of the website - to fill out either the lessons or contact form.

## Features
 
All the pages feature a typical **header** that users will be familiar with; a responsive **navigation bar** which includes the Classic Cakes **logo** in the top left and links to the website’s other pages in the top right. 
They all also feature a **footer** with **telephone contact information** as well as **social media icons** which link to Classic Cakes’ facebook and instagram pages.
 
Each page also includes **headings** relevant to the page on the left third below the header, and either a **hero image** or **hero video** on the right two thirds below the header. 
The purpose of both the headings and the images/video is to either verbally or visually reinforce the purpose of the page in an eye-catching way that will give a positive emotional response to the user.
 
##### Home
 
The headings on the Home page contain some **compelling copy** which delivers the main message on the page and encourages the user to explore the page further. 
There is also a **call to action button** here guiding the user to visit the Lessons page.
 
The hero image on the Home page is visible on desktops and tablet devices, as at these larger screen sizes the user can absorb the information they convey. 
On smaller screen sizes, the hero image is not displayed as this gives a cleaner view of the headings and therefore the purpose of the page, and also reduces the mobile users’ data consumption.
 
The next section of the page details the types of product on offer, using interactive **photographs** as well as **customer reviews** relating to the product they are paired with. 
On smaller screen sizes, the reviews are not displayed as this would hinder the user’s ability to quickly establish what Classic Cake’s main product offerings are.
 
##### Gallery
 
The Gallery page contains 24 **thumbnail images** laid out at equal distance, the number on each row is adapted to the width of the screen.
Each thumbnail is circular, is in keeping with the images found on the Home page and features various types of cake on offer.
